# Cheqlist
Cheqlist is a task management application that aims to streamline the process of stepping through a list of tasks in a particular order
so that you can focus on the tasks themselves rather than maintaining your position in the list. Users create checklists for larger
tasks or chores and can easily see what step is next, mark the item as done or reviewed, then move on to the next task as listed.
